			<h2>Dive into Android NDK</h2>
			After we have realized that compilation of <i>C</i> and <i>Java</i> is done in complete different worlds,
			we want to dive smoothly into the <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/index.html">Android NDK</a> (native developer kit),
			which combines these two worlds within an Android application. First we are going to take a glance at the Java Native Interface (JNI), 
			which lets us call <i>C-functions</i> within Java. Second the NDK basics will be explained. After that I tried to dive in with a little example-project in Android Studio
			- and crashed really frustrating. Finally I tried the same with Eclipse and become happy again :)
